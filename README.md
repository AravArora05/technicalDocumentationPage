# technicalDocumentationPage
Learning more in-depth HTML/CSS through FreeCodeCamp. This project is the first project in where I've learned to use responsive web design! It's Project #3

Description: Part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification curriculum, this project involves creating a technical documentation page using flexbox. We're supposed to have a navigation bar, and we must ensure that users of all devices can utilise this website!

Features:

CSS Styling:
- Implements a modern and sleek design with vibrant color schemes, enhancing the visual appeal of the technical documentation page
- Incorporates intuitive anchor links for effortless navigation to different sections of the page, facilitating a smooth browsing experience for users
- Implements a dynamic and colorful navigation bar located at the left-hand side of the page!
- Code Snippets: Includes code snippets with relevant headers to make it so the user can easily locate the information they are seeking!
  
Remarks: On this project, I definetly wanted to take the next steps on learning about responsive web design! I think that I understand the important conceptual concepts about layouts well, but I didn't really understand media queries. I watched a couple of videos along with the FCC tutorials, and I was able to use them!
I created two media queries, one for tablets and one for phones. I'll add images/videos underneath to show the responsiveness aspect of the website!

Something that I really wanted to do a better job with is learning CSS variables and pseudoselectors. We haven't covered variables yet in the class, but I watched a Kevin Powell video on them! Here is the use!
